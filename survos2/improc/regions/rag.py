    """Creates a Region Adjacency Graph between superpixels.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rlabels : 2D or 3D ndarray
        Input superpixel labels for a 2D or 3D image.
    connectivity : int, optional
        Order of the neighbours, which must have a value of ${1, 2}$.
        For a 2D image `1` corresponds to 4-connected pixels while `2`
        corresponds to 8-connected pixels. For a 3D image `1` and `2`
        correspond to 6-connected and 18-connected voxels respectively.
    min_boundary : int, optional
        Minimum number of boundary pixels that a pair of superpixels
        need to share in order to consider them neighbours.
    norm_counts : string, optional
        Normalize the number of boundary pixels that any pair of
        superpixels share. Possible values are 'unit' which performs
        unit normalization as `counts /= counts.max()` and
        `margin` which performs `counts = np.max(counts, margin) / margin`.
    margin : int, optional
        An heuristic number of boundary pixels required to consider two
        neighbouring superpixels *perfect neighbours*. Used only if
        `norm_counts='margin'`.

    Returns
    -------
    graph : RAG (subclass of networkx.Graph)
        An undirected graph containing all the superpixels as nodes
        and the connections between them as edges. The number of
        boundary pixels that a pair of superpixels share is returned
        as an edge property: `boundary`.
